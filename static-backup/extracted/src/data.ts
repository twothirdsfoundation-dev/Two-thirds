Through the Two-Thirds Community Foundation, Bindu enrolled in a comprehensive 6-week skill training and financial literacy program. Today, she leads a cooperative of 15 women fabricating bio-degradable, value-added shell and coir products. 'We don't borrow from informal lenders anymore,' she smiles. 'We have digital savings accounts and decide our own prices.'",

    content: "Kerala's coastline faces massive annual erosion under cyclone surges. While brick and concrete seawalls often sink or worsen neighboring beach erosion, the Two-Thirds Community Foundation has championed a living shield approach. Working with traditional fishermen who know the local estuary tides, our team led volunteer groups in planting 3,200 mangrove saplings. Eight years later, these trees have expanded into a dense forest zone, stabilizing the shoreline, rebuilding fish breeding environments, and shielding homes from wild tidal waves.",

Seeing this, the Foundation mobilized young village leaders to renovate a container room into a vibrant community library. Equipped with second-hand computers, high-speed internet, and academic guides, several volunteer tutors provide structured evening classes. The centre currently serves 75 eager students. Already, 5 participants have successfully secured fully-funded higher education scholarships!",
